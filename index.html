				<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Davis and I am a third year university student currently enrolled
				in the <b>Computer Science/Business Administration Double Degree</b> program offered jointly by the <b>University
				of Waterloo</b> and <b>Wilfrid Laurier University</b>. This program allows me to gain the technical skills essential
				to a software engineer, as well as understand the role of software and technology within a larger business
				context.</p>
				<p>I have many hobbies and interests, programming and technology is only the tip of the iceberg, I also love
				reading up on the latest in business and economics, and I have a keen interest in global economy, political science,
				and philosophy. I have also been playing guitar for more than five years.</p>
				<p>Enjoy your stay at my site! If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please do not hesitate to
				<a href="mailto:davis@daviswang.com">contact me</a>! I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

					<h2>More About Me</h2>
				<img src="images/itworkplace.gif" class="floating" title="public misconception of software engineers, isn't it?">
				<p>It started with the original Super Mario Bros. That was the game that captivated me and my
				interest in computers and technologies in general. I first started taking computer literacy
				courses in elementary school, winning my own Pentium I system back in the day. Then in middle school and high school, I started
				learning about programming languages and web technologies. I decided to apply to University of
				Waterloo, well known for its computer science program and its world class co-op program. I 
				eventually settled on the double degree program, I felt the business aspect of the program is a
				great compliment to computer science and it would open up more doors for me. My interest in 
				entrepreneurship, finance, macroeconomics, and other business topics has since grown to match 
				my interest for programming and technologies, and now, I consider them an integral part of my life.</p>	

				<p>Besides programming and business, I also play guitar, I also love hiking and taking photos, 
				especially of nature. Of course, I also looove video games! (D3 and SC2 anyone?)

				<h2>Coding Projects</h2>
				<div>
					<p><b>HttpStatusCodeChecker</b> is a utility I whipped up one night to check the HTTP status code of all the resources of a given URL, this utility uses Jsoup for DOM parsing and the java.net package for
					request and response code handling. You can download the jar with all dependencies packed <a href="projects/HttpStatusCodeChecker.zip">here</a>. For more information on the utility and how to use it , read the enclosed readme file.</p>

					<p><b>Chess</b> is an object oriented implementation of the board game I wrote for my high school computer science course, using the java.swing toolkit and JPanels.
					Different chess pieces and their legal moves logic are in separate classes, all of which inherit
					from a Piece superclass. The other game logic (such as checking for checkmates) are contained in GamePanel, which is instantiated by MainApplet, 
					a wrapper class that enables the program to be embedded in a browser. The source code for the program can be found <a href="projects/Chess.zip">here</a>.</p>
					<p><b>More to come soon!</b> </p>

				<h2>Photography</h2>
				<div>
					<p>
					I love photography, I find that photos are the best way to preserve a memory or an experience,
					it's true, photos are worth a thousand words (and more!). Here is a small sample of my work taken with an iPhone 4 or
					Canon point-and-shoot. <!-- For a more comprehensive portfolio, please click here. -->

				<h2>Writing</h2>
				<div>
					<p>I like writing, not as much I as like photography but I still take time from my day to write. An <a href="images/article.jpg" class="fancybox">article</a> I wrote was published on March 14th, 2012 (pi day!) in the Metro Toronto newspaper as part of a weekly Student Voice column. The original article on TalentEgg can be found <a href="http://talentegg.ca/studentvoice/2011/10/108-davis-wang-pursue-relevant-volunteering-opportunities/">here</a>.</p>
					<p>I've also written a <a href="http://blog.tagged.com/2012/04/automated-testing-at-tagged/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for Tagged titled "Automated Testing at Tagged" covering the basic design methodology and libraries used by Tagged for automated testing.</p>
